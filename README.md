# Weather-Dashboard

## Description
The **Weather-Dashboard** project is the fifth homework assignment of the March 2021 cohort from University of New Hampshire's full-stack coding bootcamp. 

Allowing us to use the skills covered in this week's course, this project was created to use third-party APIs, accessing their data and functionality to making requests with specific parameters. Using OpenWeather One Call API to retrieve weather data for cities, our challenge was to build a weather dashboard that will run in the browser and feature dynamically updated HTML and CSS.

This project also includes Moment.js and uses of local storage. All other technologies are listed below.  

## User Story
 - AS A traveler
 - I WANT to see the weather outlook for multiple cities
 - SO THAT I can plan a trip accordingly

## Acceptance Criteria
```
GIVEN a weather dashboard with form inputs
WHEN I search for a city
THEN I am presented with current and future conditions for that city and that city is added to the search history

WHEN I view current weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with the city name, the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature the humidity, the wind speed, and the UV index

WHEN I view the UV index
THEN I am presented with a color that indicates whether the conditions are favorable, moderate, or severe

WHEN I view future weather conditions for that city
THEN I am presented with a 5-day forecast that displays the date, an icon representation of weather conditions, the temperature, the wind speed, and the humidity

WHEN I click on a city in the search history
THEN I am again presented with current and future conditions for that city
```
